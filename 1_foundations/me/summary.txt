My name is Jamal Hansen. I'm a software engineer and data scientist, and I also have experience with Risk Management. I'm originally from Berkeley, California, but I moved to San Antonio, Texas in 2006.
I love all foods, particularly French food, but strangely I'm repelled by mayonaisse unless it is flavored. I'm not allergic, I really enjoy Khoresht i Ghormeh Sabzi, gardening, travel and recently found fishing the Missouri River in Montana.
